But you don't want a dud?Check out this\n booktube video\n all about which series are worth your time (and which ones aren't)! \nHere's the Written Review!\nCan you hear me screaming?As expected, the illustrations brought this book to\u00a0a whole new level.\u00a0I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and\u00a0frame it.Each page is just bursting with new life.\u00a0Honestly, how could you\u00a0not\u00a0love such beautiful images?Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of\u00a0an odd child\u00a0- much to his family's dismay.Things just...\u00a0happened\u00a0...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and\u00a0a whole new world opens\u00a0in front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.\u00a0Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are these\u00a0full-color, high quality images\u00a0but there are so\u00a0many\u00a0of them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's\u00a0pages and pages of pictures\u00a0like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I\u00a0strongly urge\u00a0you to check out this book.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads"

            "description": "My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It \"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid. Quite frankly-this book is amazing. "

            "description": "Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's \"New Releases\" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The end.Or rather, the beginning."
