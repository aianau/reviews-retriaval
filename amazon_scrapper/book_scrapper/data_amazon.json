Also, I deliberately waited for a month or so after I finished the show because I didn't want that experience to interfere with the reading experience. I had done both things wrong. First of all, it's a great show, but that's not what I'm reviewing here. The book is so much better (as always). And because there were really big changes made when it was turned into the show, there is no reason not to enjoy both versions.  I thought that the world building is really exceptional here. The whole system and the workings of society are very well thought out. The writing and also the twists and turns in the story elevate this book among the great classics, at least for me. It instantly became one of my all-time-favorites.  So I'm planning to read the rest of the series for sure.  I recommend this to sci-fi fans and detective story enthusiasts alike. Also, I recommend this to everyone :D</span>"

            "content": "Wow, I was not expecting the book to be this good when I bought it.  I typically have lower standards for books on Kindle Daily Deals due to the some of the offerings I see and the lower prices, but this book was amazing sci-fi/noir mystery.  The writing was great and the whole story flowed very well to an exciting conclusion.  This is a pretty long book in a very good way, I couldn't believe how much the author managed to fit in.  The sci-fi concepts behind the book were also very interesting, had never read about concepts like this before.  Definitely seems like a very realistic dystopian future in some ways and really makes you appreciate something as simple as human mortality.  Background: I typically buy my Kindle books as part of the Kindle Daily Deals and plan them for airplane reading or times when I am away from home and cannot do more exciting or responsible tasks.  This means that my standards are not too high and I am looking for books in the beach read category under the fantasy/sci-fi genres.  I try to rate fairly on the star scale and personally consider anything 3 stars and up to be fine.</span>"

            "content": "Apparently, I was not as impressed with this book are several other people. The reason I was not impressed is that the book is really a CSI-style murder mystery mixed with a dollop of Sci-Fi sounding jargon and made-up words, along with a few erotic scenes thrown in for some unknown reason. The erotic scenes struck me as completely gratuitous and irrelevant to the story line, and I found myself skipping over them if they were more than a sentence or two long. Character development is thin, transparent, and uninteresting. I did read the entire book but found myself not in the least captivated and found it a bit of a slog to get through. I have no intention whatsoever of reading the subsequent volumes of the series.</span>"

Of course, that is only if you want an amazingly well-constructed SF work done as futuristic detective \"noir\" - it's got the plot, the thoughtful working out of how the particular tech referenced by the title affects society, a tough and resourceful protagonist, good/bad male/female cops/perps/vics - you name it. Finally, it passes a crucial test for me - it holds up quite well over multiple re-reads.  Along with the other two books in the \"Takeshi Kovacs\" series (\"Broken Angels\" and \"Woken Furies\"), the author has carved out a universe that is great fun to experience - time and again.</span>"

            "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
            "content": "Very much enjoyed this.  Fairly grim, somewhat dystopian future setting...which isn't a bad thing, I just have to be in the mood for that.  The most thought provoking thing for me was how thoroughly the \"resleeving\" of one's consciousness in another body is ingrained in the society/culture of the setting.  I think I expected that capability to be something more overtly central to the story...\"Hey wow I'm in a new body!\".  Instead, it is woven throughout as a common part of life in this time, fundamental to the story but not THE story.  It was fascinating to see how the author integrated that capability, and its consequences, into so much of what it means to live in this time.  I would recommend this book on exploring those things alone.  The story itself was very good and drew me in.  It was not a casual read; I recognized early on I needed to pay attention :)  Character development is an interesting thing in a world where some can attain near-immortality (by sleeving into a new body) and one must adjust to and is influenced by sleeving into the body of another (ex: a non-smoker 'inheriting' the urges and habits once sleeved into the body of a smoker).  I look forward to reading the second book!</span>"

            "content": "Harsh raw worlds, run by wars and politics, by rich people who will never die. Souls and memory stored digitally, and death just means having to worry if you can afford the next body, or 'sleeve'. Except for the rich, who can grow their own clones, ready to put on like clothing when they wished.  And in this harsh reality, a 'Meth', or Methusila, is murdered, and when his backup is restored, missing the last 24 hours of his life, he's pissed. He can't believe he'd kill himself, so he 'hires' Takeshi Kovacs to find his murder.  With Bladerunner bleakness, old Earth is full of those who'd be dying, if Real Death were even a thing anymore. An interesting take, and some good (if ugly) world building. The violence is pretty graphic, and unlrelenting at times, but not only the mystery pulled me in, but watching Takeshi work as well. The character was interesting enough to keep my interested, even through the story's most violent scenes.</span>"

A couple of surprises right at the end. Upon finishing, I immediately downloaded the next book in the series.</span>"

If you watched the Altered Carbon series on Netflix, you may know that many liberties were taken with the plot: Key scenarios omitted, others added; multiple characters inexplicably morphed into one another. Whether of not you enjoyed the TV series, if you love sci-fi, I would highly recommend this book and the entire Kovacs trilogy.  Morgan\u2019s vision of the future is so well-imagined. If you're a fan of Michael Marshall Smith's \"Spares\", \"Altered Carbon\" compliments it perfectly.</span>"

The ideas in Altered Carbon are fantastic. The idea of sleeves, stacks, Meths and hotels (like the Hendrix, which are AI buildings gone renegade are great). However, the story has no heart; Takeshi Kovac only feels the need for sex and revenge - his personality flat lines through the whole book, which in turn makes it hard to care as a reader about what he's doing or why. There is no humour, only machismo and revenge. One star.</span>"

I can believe this world, it scares and amazes, impresses and stops just short of bewildering. Pushes the limits.  Police / Private Detective genre, that comes closest! 'The Expanse' is another fine example ( I love it too; book and film) and though similar in many ways, this one is better.  STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</span>"

Richard Morgan has managed a feat unique in my experience: a credible detective story set in an SF future where technology seemingly allows anything to be possible.
